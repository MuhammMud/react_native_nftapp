Due to an error during the upload the files did not all upload under their designated folders as such I wil detail them below.

DETAILS.js and HOME.js go under the screens folder.

BUTTON, DETAILSBID, DETAILSDESC, FOCUSEDSTATUSBAR, HOMEHEADER, INDEX, NFTCARD, SUBINFO (.js). All go under components folder.

ASSETS, DUMMY, INDEX, THEME (.js) all fall under the constants folder.
